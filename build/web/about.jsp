                                <p>A blood bank is a center where blood gathered as a result of blood donation is stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term "blood bank" typically refers to a division of a hospital where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed.</p>
                                <p>Blood banking refers to the process of collecting, separating, and storing blood. The first U.S. blood bank was established in 1936. Today, blood banks collect blood and separate it into its various components so they can be used most effectively according to the needs of the patient. Red blood cells carry oxygen, platelets help the blood clot, and plasma has specific proteins that allow proper regulation of coagulation and healing. Although research has yielded drugs that help people's bone marrow produce new blood cells more rapidly, the body's response time can still take weeks, thus donated blood remains an important and more immediate life-saving resource.</p>
                                <h4>Blood type</h4>
                                <p>A blood type is a classification of blood, based on the presence and absence of antibodies and inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells. These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending on the blood group system.</p>
                                <h4>The ABO system</h4>
                                <p>There are four main blood groups defined by the ABO system:</p>
                                <ul>
<li><strong>blood group A&nbsp;–</strong> has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma </li>
<li><strong>blood group B</strong> &nbsp;– has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma </li>
<li><strong>blood group O</strong> &nbsp;– has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma </li>
<li><strong>blood group AB</strong> &nbsp;– has both A and B antigens, but no antibodies </li>
</ul>
